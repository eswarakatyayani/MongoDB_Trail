# MongoDB_Trail
run the command prompt as flask project 
it will be running in http://127.0.0.1:5000
Save the database in Mongodb compass as mongodb1.student
add the mogodb1.student into .py file 
open postman for GET & POST outputs

#Comparing with ordinary projects 
We use flask framework 
But for database we used Sqllite3 to store database and put that .db file into our Flask Project folder(NOT INISIDE THE .py file) and for outputs we used web browser.
But here we use MongoDb Compass to store database and put that file into .py file and for outputs we use Postman to check
